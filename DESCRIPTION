Description: Statistical analysis to identify a stable isotope incorporating taxa obtained as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Scaled absolute abundances are utilized which are obtained from relative abundance of MAGs and sequins (spike-ins) of known concentration over a range of coverages. Using absolute abundances and bootstrapping, atom fraction excess of MAGs is estimated, and thereby, incorporators of a stable isotope are identified. Please refer Hungate et al. (2015) (doi:10.1128/AEM.02280-15) for details on quantitative stable isotope probing. Additionally, the bouyant density plots for stable isotope incorporating MAGs will also be provided.
